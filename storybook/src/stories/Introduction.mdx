# BuilderCSS

Semantic HTML templates with pure CSS styling - No utility classes, no build tools, no complexity.

## Philosophy

BuilderCSS follows the principle: **Same HTML + Different CSS = Different Theme**

- HTML structure never changes
- Only CSS and optional JS for interactivity change
- Enables CSS-only theming and variable customization

## Template Categories

### Layouts
Application shell layouts like Stacked, Sidebar, Dashboard, Auth, Docs, Fullscreen, and Split.

### Pages
Full page templates like Home, About, Contact, Blog, Article, Pricing, Product, Careers, Changelog, Docs, Privacy, Terms, Error, NotFound, and Waitlist.

### Sections
Reusable section components like Hero, Features, CTA, FAQ, Team, Testimonials, Pricing, Stats, Newsletter, and Logos.

### Containers
Overlay and container components like Modal, Drawer, Slideover, Fullscreen, Popup, Command, Inline, and Toast.

### Views
Dashboard view components like APIKeys, Billing, Calendar, Chat, Dashboard, Feed, Form, Gallery, Kanban, List, Profile, Settings, Stats, Table, and Timeline.

## Getting Started

Browse the templates in the sidebar to see them in action. Use the theme toggle in the toolbar to switch between light and dark modes.

Each template story includes:
- Live preview of the semantic HTML
- Props/controls to customize content
- Documentation of the HTML structure
